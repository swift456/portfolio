# Next few weeks
At the end of next week (28 July) I shall finish my placement with the Faculty of Business and Physical Sciences. Over the course of the placement, which commenced on the 3rd July, I have developed learning materials which are to be used to teach the concept of doxing and the real life implications of it. This ties into the current GCSE Curriculum, inside of the Digital Technologies subject, and is also relevant to the Digital Citizenship element of PSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Economic education). Once all of the constituent material has been produced I shall either include a link to the material or a download of the material made available on this site. 

# August
Upon completion of the placement my plans are for a job in any of the following areas; data analytics, networking, cybersecurity, machine learning, web development, and game/software development. I have already begun applying for jobs in the aforementioned areas, however, the earliest start dates out of all the jobs I have currently applied for around the end of August. This means that, unless I get sought out by a recruiter or the recruitment process for a job hastens significantly, I am going to be left with comparatively little to do for the next month. 

## Mars Lander 2
In order to fill my time I have considered remaking the game that I made for my major project. It wouldn't be a remake from the ground up, instead it would be using the current assets and systems implemented in the game. The changes that I want to make will require heavy refactoring of the code, and with that the goal of the development is to add enough content and features that the version of the game at the end diverges enough from the original, so that it is more like a game rather than an update. A further stretch goal of this is that potentially, if enough work is done on the game, it could potentially be monetized on Steam or itch.io. It's nice to think about, a game on the market, however this isn't the primary motivation for me, the core motivation for me is it gives me the ability to hone my craft and remain engaged in my degree field.
