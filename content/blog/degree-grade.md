# My Degree Classification
I am happy to announce that upon receiving my semester two results I have been awarded a First Class Honours BSc Degree in Computer Science. The last three years have truly flown by, and this is in part due to the great friends I have made throughout. I want to thank the staff at Aberystwyth University for their commitment to providing supportive and passionate guidance throughout.

## What's next?
For the next month I am going to be working with the Information Studies department in an outreach capacity. I'm not sure what this work placement will include as of yet however I am confident that it will provide a good extension onto the work I completed for my major project, as that had a heavy outreach/education focus.

## And after that?
I will most likely continue looking for employment opportunities around Aberystwyth, however, so far I haven't had much success with this. If I decide to go for a job outside of my area of study I might be more successful. With my award of a first in my degree I feel more confident pursuing a job in my degree topic, and feel it would be a disservice to myself after my academic performance to seek anything else. As of this moment I have applied for several data analyst positions in and around the North West of England and Wales.

### Project Feedback
In the coming days I may update my Mars Lander project page to include a link to feedback I have received on my completed work from the two lecturers who supervised the project.
